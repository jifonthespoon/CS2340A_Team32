/**
 * Provides models and utilities for interacting with Firebase services, including authentication
 * and database operations.
 * This package encapsulates the necessary Firebase initialization and provides simplified access
 * to Firebase services
 * such as FirebaseAuth for user authentication and FirebaseDatabase for real-time data storage and
 * retrieval.
 *
 * <p>Classes in this package are designed to be used across the application to ensure consistent
 * access to Firebase
 * services, promoting a clean architecture by abstracting Firebase-specific details away from the
 * application's core logic.</p>
